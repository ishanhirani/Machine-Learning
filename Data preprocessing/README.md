Q1: Data Preprocessing 
A csv file has been provided to you at this link. The given dataset is related to cars and contains
26 columns. In the given dataset, “Price” is the target variable (i.e., the output). The marks
distribution according to the tasks are as follows:

1. Assign a type to each of the following features (a) Model, (b) Type, (c) Max. Price and
(d) Airbags from the following: ordinal/nominal/ratio/interval scale.
2. Write a function to handle the missing values in the dataset (e.g., any NA, NaN values).
3. Write a function to reduce noise (any error in the feature) in individual attributes.
4. Write a function to encode all the categorical features in the dataset according to the
type of variable jointly.
5. Write a function to normalize / scale the features either individually or jointly.
6. Write a function to create a random split of the data into train, validation and test sets in
the ratio of [70:20:10].
7. What do you learn from this exercise (100 words)
